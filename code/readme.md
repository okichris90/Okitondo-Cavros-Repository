This is a folder to store all R and Rmd scripts for our project.

The scripts load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders.

**You can check out our analysis by executing code in order. First run the processing code, which will produce the processed data from our raw data. Then run the analysis scripts, which will take the processed data and produce some results. Then you can run the manuscript file, which pulls in the generated results and displays them.**
