  abstract = {Improving vaccination rates among marginalized populations is an important priority among public policy makers and healthcare providers in the United States of America (U.S.). Racial/ethnic minorities have a long history of reduced vaccination rates relative to white Americans (Khan, Hall, Tanner, \& Marlow, 2018), while people with disabilities (PWD) have varied rates of vaccine use (Diab \& Johnston, 2004; O'Neill, Newall, Antolovich, Lima, \& Danchin, 2019). Yet, little is known about vaccine use among individuals who belong to both groups. This study examines the intersectional effects of race/ethnicity and disability on flu vaccine use. We used the 2015\textendash 2018 National Health Interview Survey to examine the odds of flu vaccine use by race/ethnicity, disability, and their interaction among adults aged 18+ in the U.S. non-institutionalized, civilian population stratified by age groups. For each unit increase in disability scores, we found a significant race-by-disability interaction for young black adults (18\textendash 39 years) who had higher odds of getting the flu vaccine compared to white adults in the same age group. A significant interaction occurred for middle-aged Hispanic vs. white adults (40\textendash 64 years) who had higher odds of getting the flu vaccine as their disability scores increased. Black vs. white adults were less likely to get the flu vaccine across all age groups irrespective of disability and other covariates, while results were more mixed among other racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, people with disabilities had higher odds of flu vaccination. Further, race/ethnicity had a moderating effect on the relationship between disability and flu vaccination and an interaction effect occurred between disability and certain racial/ethnic groups when stratified by age.},

  abstract = {While the influenza vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women, influenza vaccine coverage among this high-risk population remains inadequate. Factors associated with vaccine coverage among pregnant women, including insurance status, are poorly understood. In a cross-sectional study of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2012 to 2018, we evaluated predictors of self-reported influenza vaccine coverage in pregnant women. Among 1,942 pregnant women surveyed, 39\% reported receiving the influenza vaccine in accordance with national recommendations. Influenza vaccine coverage increased by 8 percentage points from 2012 to 2018. Only 15\% of uninsured pregnant women received the influenza vaccine, compared to 41\% of those with insurance (design-corrected F-test, p-value {$<$} 0.001). In the multivariate Poisson regression analysis, significant predictors of influenza vaccine coverage were health insurance (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.23\textendash 2.93), ratio of household income to federal poverty level (FPL) threshold greater than 400\% (PR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.20\textendash 1.96), graduate school education (PR 1.52, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 2.23), and the 2015\textendash 2018 survey year period (PR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.08\textendash 1.49). While previous literature focuses heavily on demographics, our research underscores the need to further explore modifiable factors that impact vaccine uptake during pregnancy, particularly the interplay between health insurance and access to care.},

Methods. We queried the 2019 National Health Interview Survey for respondents aged 18 years and older. To provide national estimates of influenza vaccination coverage, we performed sample-weighted multivariable logistic regressions and predicted marginal modeling while adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and urban\textendash rural household designation. Results. After weighting, 48.1\%, 46.2\%, and 43.6\% of adults from large metropolitan, small and medium metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan areas, respectively, received the influenza vaccine. Additionally, there was a trend toward declining influenza vaccination status from large metropolitan to rural areas in all age groups, both genders, and multiple racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions. Self-reported influenza vaccination rates were lower in rural than in urban areas among adults of all age groups and both genders.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether race/ethnicity and disability status are associated with the receipt of two vaccines (influenza and pneumococcal) among older adults living in Florida. METHODS: Using the 2011-2015 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a cross-sectional survey, we ran bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the associations for race/ethnicity and disability status with receipt of vaccinations among individuals 65 years and older. Interactions between race/ethnicity and disability status were tested in each model. RESULTS: Among our study sample, 68\% received the pneumococcal vaccine in their lifetime and 54\% of them received influenza vaccine in the past 12 months. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to receive both vaccines compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Older adults with a disability were more likely to receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccines compared to those without. A significant interaction was observed between race/ethnicity and disability status for predicting pneumococcal vaccination receipt. CONCLUSIONS: Large proportions of older adults in Florida continue to go without needed vaccinations. Although race/ethnicity and disability status were shown to have some association with receipt of vaccines, having a regular source of care, employment and income also were shown to be important predictors.},

We sought to estimate changes in the likelihood of receiving an influenza vaccine across different demographic subgroups during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this cohort study, we analyzed influenza vaccine uptake from 2019 to 2020 using Optum commercial insurance claims data. Eligible individuals were aged 18 or above in 2018 and continuously enrolled from 08/01/2018 through 12/31/2020. Multivariable logistic regressions were fitted for the individual-level influenza vaccine uptake. Adjusting for demographic factors and medical histories, we estimated probabilities of receiving influenza vaccines before and after the COVID-19 pandemic across demographic subgroups. Results From August to December 2019, unadjusted influenza vaccination rate was 42.3\%, while in the same period of 2020, the vaccination rate increased to 45.9\%. Females had a higher vaccination rate in 2019 (OR: 1.16, 95\% CI 1.15\textendash 1.16), but the increase was larger for males. Blacks and Hispanics had lower vaccination rates relative to whites in both flu seasons. Hispanics showed a greater increase in vaccination rate, increasing by 7.8 percentage points (p {$<$} .001) compared to 4.4 (p {$<$} .001) for whites. The vaccination rate for Blacks increased by 5.2 percentage points (p {$<$} .001). All income groups experienced vaccination improvements, but poorer individuals had lower vaccination rates in both seasons. The most profound disparities occurred when educational cohort were considered. The vaccination rate increased among college-educated enrollees by 8.8 percentage points (p {$<$} .001) during the pandemic compared to an increase of 2.8 percentage points (p {$<$} .001) for enrollees with less than a 12th grade education. Past influenza infections or vaccination increased the likelihood of vaccination (p {$<$} .001). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased influenza vaccine utilization.

Food security, good nutrition, and high-quality diets are critical for the wellbeing of older adults.

In this study, we analyzed data on 40,555 adults aged\,{$\geq$}\,65 years from the 2014\textendash 2018 National Health Interview Survey in the United States. Through multiple hierarchical logistic regression models, we investigated the associations between food insecurity and influenza and pneumonia vaccines uptake in this population. We found that, during 2014\textendash 2018, about 12.6 million (5.3\%) adults aged\,{$\geq$}\,65 years lived in food-insecure households in the United States. Of those, 60.6\% reported getting an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, and 54.2\% reported ever getting a pneumonia vaccine.

Influenza hospitalizations from the 2009 to 2010 season to the 2018 to 2019 season were analyzed. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to July 2021.The main outcomes were age-adjusted and age-stratified rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, ICU admission, and in-hospital death by race and ethnicity overall and by influenza season.Among 113\,352 persons with an influenza-associated hospitalization (34\,436 persons [32.0\%] aged {$\geq$}75 years; 61\,009 [53.8\%] women), 70\,225 persons (62.3\%) were non-Hispanic White (White), 24\,850 persons (21.6\%) were non-Hispanic Black (Black), 11\,903 persons (10.3\%) were Hispanic, 5517 persons (5.1\%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and 857 persons (0.7\%) were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native. Among persons aged younger than 75 years and compared with White persons of the same ages, Black persons were more likely to be hospitalized (eg, age 50-64 years: rate ratio [RR], 2.50 95\% CI, 2.43-2.57) and to be admitted to an ICU (eg, age 50-64 years: RR, 2.09; 95\% CI, 1.96-2.23). Among persons aged younger than 50 years and compared with White persons of the same ages, American Indian or Alaska Native persons were more likely to be hospitalized (eg, age 18-49 years: RR, 1.72; 95\% CI, 1.51-1.96) and to be admitted to an ICU (eg, age 18-49 years: RR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.42). Among children aged 4 years or younger and compared with White children, hospitalization rates were higher in Black children (RR, 2.21; 95\% CI, 2.10-2.33), Hispanic children (RR, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.77-1.97), American Indian or Alaska Native children (RR, 3.00; 95\% CI, 2.55-3.53), and Asian or Pacific Islander children (RR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.38), as were rates of ICU admission (Black children: RR, 2.74; 95\% CI, 2.43-3.09; Hispanic children: RR, 1.96; 95\% CI, 1.73-2.23; American Indian and Alaska Native children: RR, 3.51; 95\% CI, 2.45-5.05). In this age group and compared with White children, in-hospital death rates were higher among Hispanic children (RR, 2.98; 95\% CI, 1.23-7.19), Black children (RR, 3.39; 95\% CI, 1.40-8.18), and Asian or Pacific Islander children (RR, 4.35; 95\% CI, 1.55-12.22). Few differences were observed in rates of severe influenza-associated outcomes by race and ethnicity among adults aged 75 years or older. For example, in this age group, compared with White adults, hospitalization rates were slightly higher only among Black adults (RR, 1.05; 95\% CI 1.02-1.09). Overall, Black persons had the highest age-adjusted hospitalization rate (68.8 [95\% CI, 68.0-69.7] hospitalizations per 100\,000 population) and ICU admission rate (11.6 [95\% CI, 11.2-11.9] admissions per 100\,000 population).This cross-sectional study found racial and ethnic disparities in rates of severe influenza-associated disease. These data identified subgroups for whom improvements in influenza prevention efforts could be targeted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predominance of 2 antigenically drifted influenza viruses during the 2019-2020 season offered an opportunity to assess vaccine effectiveness against life-threatening pediatric influenza disease from vaccine-mismatched viruses in the United States. METHODS: We enrolled children aged {$<$}18 years admitted to the intensive care unit with acute respiratory infection across 17 hospitals. Respiratory specimens were tested using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza viruses and sequenced. Using a test-negative design, we estimated vaccine effectiveness comparing odds of vaccination in test-positive case patients vs test-negative controls, stratifying by age, virus type, and severity. Life-threating influenza included death or invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dialysis, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: We enrolled 159 critically ill influenza case-patients (70\% {$\leq$}8 years; 51\% A/H1N1pdm09 and 25\% B-Victoria viruses) and 132 controls (69\% were aged {$\leq$}8 years). Among 56 sequenced A/H1N1pdm09 viruses, 29 (52\%) were vaccine-mismatched (A/H1N1pdm09/5A+156K) and 23 (41\%) were vaccine-matched (A/H1N1pdm09/5A+187A,189E). Among sequenced B-lineage viruses, majority (30 of 31) were vaccine-mismatched. Effectiveness against critical influenza was 63\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 38\% to 78\%) and similar by age. Effectiveness was 75\% (95\% CI, 49\% to 88\%) against life-threatening influenza vs 57\% (95\% CI, 24\% to 76\%) against non-life-threating influenza. Effectiveness was 78\% (95\% CI, 41\% to 92\%) against matched A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 47\% (95\% CI, -21\% to 77\%) against mismatched A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 75\% (95\% CI, 37\% to 90\%) against mismatched B-Victoria viruses. CONCLUSIONS: During a season when vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses predominated, vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of critical and life-threatening influenza illness in children.},

  abstract = {The seasonal incidence of influenza is often approximated as 5\%\textendash 20\%.We used 2 methods to estimate the seasonal incidence of symptomatic influenza in the United States. First, we made a statistical estimate extrapolated from influenza-associated hospitalization rates for 2010\textendash 2011 to 2015\textendash 2016, collected as part of national surveillance, covering approximately 9\% of the United States, and including the existing mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. Second, we performed a literature search and meta-analysis of published manuscripts that followed cohorts of subjects during 1996\textendash 2016 to detect laboratory-confirmed symptomatic influenza among unvaccinated persons; we adjusted this result to the US median vaccination coverage and effectiveness during 2010\textendash 2016.The statistical estimate of influenza incidence among all ages ranged from 3.0\%\textendash 11.3\% among seasons, with median values of 8.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 7.3\%\textendash 9.7\%) for all ages, 9.3\% (95\% CI, 8.2\%\textendash 11.1\%) for children \&lt;18 years, and 8.9\% (95\% CI, 8.2\%\textendash 9.9\%) for adults 18\textendash 64 years. Corresponding values for the meta-analysis were 7.1\% (95\% CI, 6.1\%\textendash 8.1\%) for all ages, 8.7\% (95\% CI, 6.6\%\textendash 10.5\%) for children, and 5.1\% (95\% CI, 3.6\%\textendash 6.6\%) for adults.The 2 approaches produced comparable results for children and persons of all ages. The statistical estimates are more versatile and permit estimation of season-to-season variation. During 2010\textendash 2016, the incidence of symptomatic influenza among vaccinated and unvaccinated US residents, including both medically attended and nonattended infections, was approximately 8\% and varied from 3\% to 11\% among seasons.},

  abstract = {Purpose Seasonal influenza vaccination is an important public health strategy to reduce preventable illness, hospitalization, and death. Because of overlapping risk factors for severe illness from seasonal influenza and COVID-19, uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccination has heightened importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed receipt of seasonal influenza vaccination among COVID-19 priority groups and further examined socio-demographic and behavioral factors associated with receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine among US adults. Methods Using the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, we classified 24,772 adults into four COVID-19 priority groups: healthcare workers, medically vulnerable, non-healthcare essential workers, and the general population. We performed multiple logistic regression to compare the relative odds of receiving the influenza vaccine by COVID-19 priority group, socio-demographics, and health-related factors. Results Healthcare workers, medically vulnerable adults, essential workers, and the general population comprised 8.9\%, 58.4\%, 6.6\%, and 26.1 \% of the US population, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of receiving influenza vaccine were significantly lower in medically vulnerable adults (aOR=0.43, 95\% CI=0.37, 0.48), essential workers (aOR=0.28, 95\% CI=0.23, 0.34), and the general population (aOR=0.32, 95\% CI=0.28, 0.37). Being young, male, Black, and having no health insurance were associated with lower relative odds of receiving the flu vaccine. Conclusions Patterns of influenza vaccine cause concern for under-coverage of populations at high risk for both seasonal influenza and COVID-19. Achieving optimal protection against vaccine-preventable respiratory illness in US adults will require emphasis on those employed outside of the healthcare sector, younger age groups, and adults with lower socioeconomic resources.},
